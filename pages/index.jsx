                        Blockchains are slow, cumbersome and inefficient so Iâ€™ve
                        become very good at working around those limitations

                      <li>
                        Iâ€™ve also become very good at debugging, since the
                        ecosystem is so new. One time I found a bug in our code
                        that had to do with the way individual bytes are stored
                        in memory, very similar to [C struct
                        packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/) if
